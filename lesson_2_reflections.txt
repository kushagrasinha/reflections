What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
a .git file is created in the directory which would contain the meta-data, hence making it a git repository
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is transitional and doesn't allow any operations to be carried out in it. Directory and repository are non transitional and allows operaions to be carried out in them.
